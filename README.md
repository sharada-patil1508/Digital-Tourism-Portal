The Digital Tourism Port is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to simplify trip planning by enabling users to book hotels and travel packages seamlessly. The application provides a user-friendly interface where travelers can browse and choose from various tour packages tailored to different destinations and budgets. Users can select hotel options, finalize their bookings, and make payments using multiple modes such as credit/debit cards, UPI, or net banking. All booking and user information is securely stored in a MySQL database, ensuring efficient data management. Additionally, the system includes functionality to delete existing records, such as user bookings or personal details, offering flexibility and control over the data. This project combines the robustness of Java Swing for the frontend with the reliability of MySQL for the backend, making it a comprehensive solution for digital tourism management.
