The Digital Tourism Port is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to simplify trip planning by enabling users to book hotels and travel packages seamlessly. The application provides a user-friendly interface where travelers can browse and choose from various tour packages tailored to different destinations and budgets. Users can select hotel options, finalize their bookings, and make payments using multiple modes such as credit/debit cards, UPI, or net banking. All booking and user information is securely stored in a MySQL database, ensuring efficient data management. Additionally, the system includes functionality to delete existing records, such as user bookings or personal details, offering flexibility and control over the data. This project combines the robustness of Java Swing for the frontend with the reliability of MySQL for the backend, making it a comprehensive solution for digital tourism management.

🔐 Login Page


The Login Page serves as the secure entry point to the Digital Tourism Port application. Designed using Java Swing, it features input fields for:

Username

Password

Along with three key buttons:

✅ Submit – Authenticates user credentials and grants access to the main dashboard

🔄 Reset – Clears the input fields for fresh entry

❌ Close – Exits the application safely

This login mechanism ensures that only authorized users can access the tourism management system, helping maintain security and user-specific access control. All login credentials are validated against records stored in the MySQL backend.
